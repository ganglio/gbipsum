I'm gonna turn over the next card.
Concentrate.
What do you think it is?
A square.
Good guess, but wrong.
Clear your head.
What do you think it is?
Is it a star?.
It is a star. Very good.
Think hard. What is it?
A circle.
Close, but definitely wrong.
All right. Ready?.
What is it?
Figure eight.
Incredible. Can you see these?
Are you cheating?
No, they're just coming to me.
Nervous?
Yes. I don't like this.
You only have 75 more to go.
What's this one?
A couple of wavy lines.
This isn't your lucky day.
I'm getting tired of this!
You volunteered.
I didn't know about the chocks.
What are you trying to prove?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP.
The effect is that it's pissing me off!
Then maybe my theory is correct!
Keep the five bucks!
Get used to that.
That's the kind of resentment your ability will provoke in people.
Do you think I have it?
You're no fluke, Jennifer.
This is it!
I need the UV lenses and the tape for the video camera.
Will you excuse me?
I'm in the middle of something, Ray.
Could you come back in an hour?.
Peter, at 1 :40 PM,
at the New York Public Library, -
ten people saw a free-floating,
vaporous apparition.
It blew books off shelves from 20 feet away!
I'm very excited.
Check it out and get back to me.
You're coming with us. Spengler took PKE valences that buried the needle.
We're close on this one.
I can feel it.
I can feel it.
We're very, very close.
I have to go now.
Could you come back, say at ...
Eight o'clock?.
That's what I was going to say.
You've finally gone around the bend.
You've been meeting every schizo who's had a paranormal experience.
I was present at an unexplained mass sponge migration.
The sponges migrated a foot and a half.
You're here!
This is very big, Peter.
Remember the time you tried to drill a hole through your head?
I'm Roger Delacorte.
I'm Dr. Venkman, Dr. Stanz, Egon.
Thank you for coming.
I hope we can clear this up quietly.
Let's not rush things.
We don't know what we have.
It had arms. It reached for me.
Arms! I can't wait to see it!
Let me ask you a couple of standard questions.
Have you or anyone in your family ever been diagnosed schizophrenic?
My uncle thought he was a saint.
I'd call that a big "yes".
Do you use drugs or alcohol?
No!
Just asking.
Are you menstruating right now?.
What has that got to do with it?
Back off. I'm a scientist.
Ray! It's moving!
Look.
This is hot.
Symmetrical book stacking,
just like in Philadelphia, 1947.
You're right. No human being would stack books like this.
Listen!
Do you smell something?
Talk about telekinetic activity.
Look at this mess!
Look at this.
Ectoplasmic residue.
Get a sample of this.
It's the real thing.
Someone blows their nose and you want to keep it?
There's more over here.
I'm getting stronger readings.
This way!
Egon, your mucous.
Has this happened to you before?
First time?
It's here.
A full-torso apparition,
and it's real.
So what do we do?
Could you come over and talk to me for a second? Right over here.
What do we do?
What do you think?.
Stop that!
One of us should speak to it.
Good idea.
Hello, I'm Peter.
Where are you from ... originally?.
The usual stuff isn't working.
I know exactly what to do.
Stay close.
Do exactly as I say.
Get ready.
Ready?. Get her!
Did you see it? What was it?
We'll get back to you.
"Get her!"
That was your whole plan.
It was scientific.
I just got over-excited.
But we touched the etheric plane.
Do you know what this means?
I'm very excited.
We have an excellent chance of catching a ghost and holding it.
This is great! lf the ionisation rate is constant, -
we could really bust some heads!
Are you serious about this?
I'm always serious.
I'm going to take back what I said about you.
You've earned it.
The possibilities are limitless.
Hey, Dean Yeager!
Are you giving us better quarters?
You're being moved offcampus.
Your grant has been terminated and you are to leave immediately.
This is preposterous.
I demand an explanation.
The university will no longer fund your activities.
But the kids love us.
Dr. Venkman ...
The purpose of science is to serve mankind, -
but you regard it as a kind of dodge or hustle.
Your theories are popular tripe and your conclusions are questionable.
You are a poor scientist.
I see.
You have no place in this university.
What a disgrace. MIT or Stanford wouldn't touch us now.
Einstein worked as a patent clerk.
Do you know how much they earn?
The university gave us money.
We didn't have to produce anything.
You've never been out of college.
The private sector expects results.
For whatever reasons, Ray ...
Call it fate ...
... call it luck, call it karma ...
... I believe everything happens for a reason.
We were destined to be thrown out.
Why?.
To go into business for ourselves.
This containment system will cost a load of bread.
Where will we get the money?.
I don't know.
You won't regret this, Ray.
I was born in that house.
Everyone has three mortgages.
At 19%? You didn't even bargain.
The interest rate alone for the first five years comes to $95,000.
We are establishing the defence science of the next decade.
"Professional paranormal investigations and Eliminations."
The franchise rights alone will make us rich.
There's office space, sleeping quarters and a full kitchen.
It seems a little pricey for a fixer-upper.
What do you think, Egon?
This building should be condemned.
There's metal fatigue, the wiring is inadequate for our power needs, -
and the neighbourhood is like a demilitarised zone.
Hey!
Does this pole still work?.
This place is great! When can we move in? You have to try this pole.
I'll get my stuff.
We should stay here tonight.
Sleep here. To try it out.
We'll take it.
Good.
Hi.
Dana, it's you.
I thought it was the drugstore.
Are you sick?.
No. I just ordered more vitamins.
I played "20-Minute Workout" at high speed and got a 10-minute workout.
Would you like a mineral water?.
I have to go to rehearsal now.
I'll take a rain check. I always have mineral water in the house.
I'm having a big party. My fourth anniversary as an accountant.
I'd like you to stop by.
I'll try to stop by, Louis.
You left your TV on. The creep down the hall phoned the manager.
I didn't know I left it on.
I tried to disconnect the cable,
but I couldn't get in, -
so I turned up my TV, too,
so everyone would think ...
I'll see you later!
I'm gonna have a shower!
Do you hearnoises atnight?
Do you dreadyour attic?
Have you everseen a ghost?
Ifso, don't walt anotherminute.
Call Ghostbusters.
Our staffis on call 24 hours a day to serve your needs.
We're ready to believe you.
Is it too subtle? Do you think people may not see the sign?
You can't park that here!
I found a car.
It needs some suspension work, -
shocks, brakes, brake pads,
lining, steering box ...
How much?
Only 4,800. Rings, mufflers ...
Janine, any calls or messages?
No.
Any customers?
No, Dr. Venkman.
Good job, isn't it?
Type something, we're paying you.
Don't stare.
You've got those bug eyes.
Janine! Sorry about the "bug eyes"
thing. I'll be in my office.
You're very handy. I can tell.
I bet you like to read, too.
Print is dead.
I read a lot myself. Some people think I'm too intellectual, -
but it's a great way to spend your spare time. I also play racquetball.
Do you have any hobbies?
I collect spores and fungus.
Hello.
Is this the Ghostbusters office?
Yes. Can I help you?
I don't have an appointment.
I'd like to talk to someone, please.
I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?
I don't know ...
It may sound unusual.
That's all we get around here.
Come into my office, Miss ...
Barrett. Dana Barrett.
And the voice said "Zuul". I slammed the refrigerator door and left.
Odd behaviour for a major appliance.
What do you think it was?
If I knew, I wouldn't be here.
Egon, what do you think?.
She's telling the truth.
Of course I am.
Who would make up a story like that?
Nutballs who come in off the street.
It could be past life experience intruding on present time.
I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact, either.
I don't believe in any of it.
That's all right. I don't either.
But there are some procedures which often bring us results.
I'll check the building's records for a history of psychic turbulence.
I'll look for the name "Zuul"
in Tobin's Spirit Guide.
I'll take Miss Barrett home and check herout.
I'll go check out her apartment.
Okay?.
If something is going to happen,
I want it to happen to me first.
That's the closet.
They hate this.
I like to torture them.
That's right, boys.
It's Dr. Venkman!
A lot of space.
Just you?
Yes.
Good.
What are you doing?
It's technical.
One of our little toys.
That's the bedroom.
But nothing ever happened in there.
What a crime ...
You don't act like a scientist.
They're usually pretty stiff.
You're more like a game-show host.
That's the kitchen?
Are these the eggs?
Yes.
Theyjumped out of their shells and cooked on the counter.
And that's when I heard that noise coming from the refrigerator.
Would you like to check the refrigerator?.
Let me check the fridge. Good call.
Oh, my God.
Look at all the junk food!
This wasn't here. There was nothing here. There was a space, -
and a building with flames coming out of it. And there were creatures.
They were growling and snarling,
and I heard a voice say "Zuul".
I'm not getting any reading.
Are you using that correctly?.
I think so.
There are no animals in there.
Either I have a monster in my kitchen or I'm crazy.
I don't think you're crazy.
That makes me feel so much better.
All I have is my work.
There's nothing else in my life.
I meet you, and I say, "There's someone with the same problem."
We both have the same problem:
You.
I'm gonna go for broke.
I am madly in love with you.
Will you please leave?
Then she threw me out of her life.
She thought I was a creep.
You are so odd.
No ...
I've got it!
I'll prove myself to you.
That's not necessary.
I'll solve your problem.
Then you'll say:
"Venkman gets things done."
"l wonder what makes him tick. Would he like to know what makes me tick?. "
You'll think of me after I'm gone.
I bet I will.
No kiss?
To our first customer.
To our first and only customer.
I need some cash.
I should take her out to dinner.
This feast represents the last of the petty cash.
Slow down.
Hello, Ghostbusters.
Of course they're serious.
You do? You have?
No kidding?
Just give me the address.
Of course,
they'll be totally discreet.
Thank you.
We got one!
It's a call!
Hey, has anybody seen a ghost?
Thank you for coming so quickly.
They're starting to ask questions.
Has it happened before?
We all know about the 12th floor.
It's been quiet for years, until two weeks ago. It was never this bad.
Did you ever report it?
Heavens, no.
The owners don't like us to talk about it. Can we handle it quietly?.
Don't worry. We handle this kind of thing all the time.
Are you supposed to be a cosmonaut?
We're exterminators.
Someone saw a cockroach on twelve.
That's got to be some cockroach.
It'll bite your head off.
Going up?
I'll take the next one.
We really haven't had a successful test of this equipment.
I blame myself.
No sense worrying now.
Why worry?. Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator.
Let's get ready. Switch me on.
What the hell are you doing?
Sorry.
We thought you were someone else.
Successful test.
I guess so.
We better split up.
We can do more damage that way.
Venkman!
Disgusting blob ...
I'll have to hold him myself.
Come in, Ray.
Venkman! I saw it! I saw it!
It's right here, looking at me.
He's an ugly little spud.
I think he can hear you.
Don't move. It won't hurt you.
What happened?
He slimed me.
Great! Actual physical contact.
Can you move?
Ray! Come in, please.
Spengler, I'm with Venkman!
He got slimed!
Great. Save some forme.
Get down here.
It wentinto a ballroom.
If you and your staff could wait here, we'll take care of everything.
There it is! On the ceiling!
That's the one that got me.
Ready?. Throw it!
I did that. It's my fault.
The table broke the fall.
I forgot to tell you not to cross the streams.
Why?.
It would be bad.
What do you mean, bad?
Imagine all life stopping and every molecule in your body exploding.
Total protonic reversal.
That's bad. Important safety tip.
Ray, take the left.
Egon, take the right.
Ray, give me one high and outside.
All right. Hold it!
Nice shooting, Tex!
The room will be ready as soon as your guests are with us.
He's gonna move! I need some room to put the trap down!
Excuse me, please.
We have to get this in the clear.
Wait! I always wanted to do this.
The flowers are still standing.
I want a confinement stream. Go!
Hold him up there!
He's gonna move! Go!
It's working, Ray.
Start bringing him down.
Maybe now you won't slime a guy with one of these.
Shorten your stream!
Don't look directly in the trap.
I looked in the trap, Ray.
Bring your streams off when I close the trap. Now!
It's in there.
That wasn't such a chore.
I want that door open now.
Stand over there.
We came, saw and kicked its ass!
Did you see it?
What is it? Will there be more?
A focused, non-terminal phantasm.
A class-5, full-roaming vapour.
A nasty one, too.
Let's talk seriously.
The entrapment will cost $4,000, -
but we have a special on storage of the beast for $1 ,000.
$5,000? I won't pay it.
That's all right,
we can just put it back.
No, no!
All right. Anything.
Thank you.
Hope we can help you again.
Today, the entire Eastern Seaboard is talking ofparanormal activity.
Alleged ghostsightings have been reported across the tri-state area.
My Grandma would spin yarns about a spectral locomotive -
that would rocket past her farm, but now ...
Ghost Fever Grips New York Ghost Cops Bust Chinatown Spook The phone-in topic is ghostbusting.
More sightings are reported.
Some maintain that the paranormal eliminators are the cause of it all.
The Ghostbusters are atlt again.
This time, at a fashionable club.
They fought the pesky poltergeist,
then danced the night away-
wlth some ofthe ladies who wltnessed the disturbance.
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
No job's too big. No fee's too big.
Does it have arms and legs?
There's one big question on everybody's mind:
"How is Elvis?"
Do you believe in UFOs, astral projections, telepathy, ESP, -
full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness monster and the theory of Atlantis?
If there's a steady paycheque,
I'll believe anything.
I have to get some sleep.
You don't look good.
I don't?
You didn't use to look like this.
Here's the paper on Brooklyn.
Here's tonight's worksheet.
Mr. Zeddmore came about the job.
You're hired. Ray Stanz, Venkman.
Can you help me, please?
Welcome aboard.
These guest conductors shouldn't scream at us in German.
The man isn't competent to conduct a symphony orchestra.
Could you wait here a minute?
This is a surprise.
That was a wonderful rehearsal.
You're the best one in your row.
Most people can't single me out.
I don't have to take this abuse from you. Everyone wants to abuse me.
You're a big celebrity now.
Do you have some information for me?
Who's the stiff?
One of the world's best musicians.
Do you have information for me?
I'd rather tell you in private.
I found the name "Zuul".
It refers to a demigod worshipped around 6000 BC by the ...
Hittites.
The Mesopotamians and Sumerians.
Zuul was the minion of Gozer.
What's Gozer?.
Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
What's he doing in my icebox?.
Could we meet Thursday night and exchange information?
I can't. I'm busy.
You seem to think there is something wrong up here.
That I enjoy spending my evenings with my clients. No ...
I'm making an exception in your case because ...
... I respect you.
As an artist, and as a dresser, too.
This is magnificent.
I'll see you Thursday.
I'll bring the Roylance Guide.
Who the hell is that?
Just an old friend.
See you Thursday!
Sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm glad you feeling better.
You're still pale, though.
What does he do?
He's a scientist.
This is where we store all the vapours and slimers we trap.
A loaded trap here. Open.
Unlock the system. Insert the trap.
Release.
Close. Lock the system.
Set your entry grid.
Neutronise the field. When the light is green, the trap is clean.
The ghost is incarcerated.
There's a man from the EPA here.
What does he want?
I don't know. I'm working too hard.
You promised to hire more help.
Someone with your qualifications could easily find a good job -
in either food service or housekeeping.
Are you gonna answer that?
I've quit betterjobs than this.
Ghostbusters! What do you want?
Can I help you?
I'm Walter Peck. I represent the Environmental Protection Agency.
Great. How's it going down there?
Are you Peter Venkman?
Yes, I'm Dr. Venkman.
Exactly what are you a doctor of?
Parapsychology and psychology.
I see. And now you catch ghosts.
You could say that.
How many have you caught?
I'm not at liberty to say.
Where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
Into a storage facility.
Is the facility on these premises?
Yes.
May I see the storage facility?.
No.
Why not?
You did not use the magic word.
What is the magic word?
"Please".
May I please see the facility?.
Why do you want to see it?
I want to know what you do here.
There are wild stories in the media.
We want to assess any environmental impact from your operation, -
Iike the presence of noxious,
hazardous chemicals.
You show me,
or I'll get a court order.
I'll sue your ass for wrongful prosecution.
You can have it your way.
It's crowded in there,
and my data points to something big.
What do you mean, big?
Say this Twinkie depicts the normal amount of psychokinetic energy ...
According to this morning's sample,
it would be a Twinkie 35 feet long.
That's a big Twinkie.
We could be on the verge of a PKE surge of dangerous proportions.
We just had a visit from the Environmental Protection Agency.
Tell him about the Twinkie.
What about the Twinkie?
Dana, it's you! Come in.
You're missing a classic party.
I have a date.
You made a date? Tonight?
I'm sorry, Louis. I forgot.
That's okay,
you can bring him along.
Maybe we'll stop by, okay?.
I'll tell everybody you're coming.
We're gonna play Twister and ...
Let me in! It's Louis!
Hello ... Hi, Mom.
I've been busy.
Everything is fine.
No, just that one time.
Oh, I am ... I will.
I won't.
Mom, I have to go. I have a date.
No one you know.
He's a Ghostbuster.
Those guys on TV.
I'll have to let you know.
Love to Dad. Bye.
Oh, shit.
Do you have any Exedrin?
I have acetylsalicylic acid.
600 tablets costs the same as 300 of a name brand. Good advice.
Smoked salmon from Nova Scotia,
$24.95 a pound.
It only cost $14.12 after taxes.
This is a promotional expense,
so I invited clients, not friends.
Have some of the Brie.
Is it too warm in here for the Brie?
Louis, I'm going home.
Don't leave yet.
Maybe if we start dancing,
others will join in.
Okay.
I've got to get the door.
Ted! Annette! I'm glad you came!
This is Ted and Annette Flemming!
Ted has a business in receivership.
Annette's drawing a salary from a deferred bonus.
They have 15,000
left on the house. So they're okay!
Who wants to play Parcheesi?
Who brought the dog?
Help! There's a bear loose in my apartment!
A bear in his apartment ...
There are not supposed to be pets in the building.
Let me in.
There's got to be a way in here.
Let me in!
Nice doggie.
Maybe I have a Milkbone.
What happened?
Someone brought a cougar in here.
I'm going to Dana Barrett's.
Hello.
That's a different look for you.
Are you the Keymaster?.
Not that I know of.
Are you the Keymaster.
Yes. I'm a friend of his.
I didn't get your name.
I am Zuul, the Gatekeeper.
What are we doing today?.
Preparing for the coming of Gozer.
The Destructor.
Are we still going out?
You could have picked up the place.
Do you want this body?.
Is this a trick question?
I guess the roses worked.
Take me now, sub-creature.
We never talk anymore.
I make it a rule not to get involved with possessed people.
It's really more of a guideline.
I want you inside me.
I can't. You have at least two people in there already.
It might be a little crowded. Stop disturbing Dr. Venkman and relax.
Put your hands on your chest.
What I'd really like to do is talk to Dana.
Dana, it's Peter.
There is no Dana, only Zuul.
Zuulie, you nut. Come on.
I want to talk to Dana.
Relax. Dana.
Can I talk to Dana?
There is no Dana, only Zuul.
You must have some singing voice.
I'll count to three. If I can't talk to Dana, there'll be trouble.
One ...
Two ...
Two and a half ...
Please come down.
I am the Keymaster.
The Destructor will come.
Gatekeeper.
I am Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer. Are you the Gatekeeper?.
Hey, do you want a ride?
Wait for the sign.
Our prisoners will be released.
You'll perish in flames!
What an asshole.
Dropping off or picking up?
Dropping off.
We picked up this guy.
I'm afraid to lock him up.
I know you guys are into this stuff,
so I figured we'd check with you.
Are you the Gatekeeper?.
You'd better bring him inside.
How kind. You're a humanitarian.
I don't think he's human.
What's your name?
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.
His name is Louis Tully.
He lives on Central Park West.
Do you want coffee, Mr. Tully?.
Do I ..?
Yes, have some.
Yes, have some.
Vinz, what sign are you waiting for?.
Gozer the Traveller will come in a pre-chosen form.
During the rectification of the Vuldronaii, he came as a Torb.
During the reconciliation of the Meketrex, he came as a giant Sloar!
Many Shubs and Zuuls were roasted in the Sloar that day!
Egon.
Excuse me.
There's something strange about that man.
I have a terrible feeling that something awful will happen to you.
I'm afraid you're gonna die.
I'll get it.
Hello?
Egon, It's Peter.
I have news from Gozer.
I'm with Dana Barrett.
The Goze has been putting some moves on my would-be girlfriend.
I think we can get her on "Wild Kingdom".
I gave her 300 cc's of Thorazine.
She's gonna take a nap now.
She says she's the Gatekeeper.
Does that make sense to you?
The Keymaster is here with me.
We have to get them together.
That would be very dangerous.
Hold on to him. I'm on my way.
Good.
Thank you, Vinz.
I need Ray here immediately.
I have to go to work.
Stay here in bed until I get back.
Ray, do you believe in God?
Never met him.
I do. I love Jesus' style.
The roofcap is made of magnesium.
What are you so involved with?
These blueprints for Dana Barrett's apartment building are very strange.
Do you remember in the Bible about when the dead would rise?
I remember Revelations 7:12.
"l looked as he opened the 6th seal.
The sun became black as sackcloth."
"The moon became as blood."
"The seas boiled. The skies fell."
Judgement day.
Judgement day.
Every religion has its myth about the end of the world.
Maybe we've been so busy lately because the dead have been rising.
How about a little music?
This way.
Excuse me!
Where do think you're going?
Step aside or you'll be arrested.
You can't come in here without a warrant or something.
Cease all commerce order, seizure of premises and an inspection order.
I'd like to do one more test.
Egon, he says they have a warrant.
This is private property.
Shut these all off.
That would be hazardous.
You're facing federal prosecution.
Shut off the beams, or we'll do it.
Turning the high-voltage containment system off would cause an explosion.
Don't patronise me! I'm not stupid!
At ease, Officer. I want to co-operate in any way I can.
You had your chance, but you insulted me. Now it's my turn.
He wants to shut down the grid.
We won't be held responsible.
Shut it off!
Don't do it! I'm warning you.
I've never seen anything like this before.
Just shut it off.
Don't be a jerk.
If he does that again, shoot him.
Don't tell me how to do myjob.
Shut it off!
Oh, shit.
Clear the building!
This is the sign!
Yeah. We're going out of business.
What happened?
The storage facility blew.
That's bad, isn't it?
Where's the Keymaster?.
Shit!
Who's the Keymaster?.
Arrest these men! They are violating the Environmental Protection Act.
This explosion is a result of it!
Your mother ..!
Columbia Building, 57th Street.
I'm in a hurry.
Guard! I want to make a phone call!
I wasn't even there!
The roofcap structure is like what NASA uses to identify dead pulsars.
Cold-riveted girders with cores of pure selenium.
Does everybody get it?
They're not made that way anymore?
Nobody ever made them like this!
The architect was either a genius or a wacko!
Ray, for a moment,
pretend I don't know anything -
about metallurgy or physics.
Just tell me what's going on.
You never studied.
The whole building is a super-conductive antenna -
that was designed expressly for pulling in spiritual turbulence.
Your girlfriend lives in the corner penthouse of Spook Central.
She's not my girlfriend.
She's interesting as a client -
because she sleeps four feet above her covers.
She barks, drools, claws.
It's the building.
This building is the door to something terrible.
The architect was lvo Shandor.
He was a doctor who performed a lot of unnecessary surgery.
He started a secret society.
Let me guess. Gozer worshippers.
Right.
"No studying" ...
After WW l, Shandor decided society was too sick to survive.
He had nearly a thousand followers.
They conducted rituals on the roof.
They intended to bring about the end of the world. Now it may happen.
So be good, forgoodness'sake!
somebody's coming We have to find a judge.
Hey! Hold it!
Are we gonna tell a federal judge -
that some mouldy Babylonian god is gonna tear up the city?.
Sumerian, not Babylonian.
I've got to get my own lawyer.
Ghostbusters, the mayor wants you.
The whole island's going crazy.
I've got to split,
the mayor wants me.
I am the Keymaster.
I am the Gatekeeper.
Stay back!
You're not giving me any answers!
We're blocking bridges, roads ...
The Ghostbusters are here.
Okay, the Ghostbusters.
Where's this Peck?.
I'm Peck. I want to make a report.
These men use nerve gasses to induce hallucinations.
People think they're seeing ghosts and they call these bozos, -
who show up with a fake light show.
Dickless here shut off our grid.
They caused an explosion!
Is this true?
Yes. This man has no dick.
All right.
That's what I heard.
What is this?
It was no light show this morning.
I've seen every form of combustion,
but this beats the hell out of me.
The walls in the 53rd Precinct were bleeding.
Good afternoon.
Your Eminence.
How are you?
You're looking good.
We're in a real fix.
What should I do?
The church won't take any position on the religious implications.
Personally,
I think it's a sign from God.
But don't quote me on that.
That's a smart move.
I won't call a press conference and tell everyone to start praying.
I've only been with the company two weeks, but I have to tell you, -
these things are real. I have seen shit that'll turn you white.
You can believe Mr. Pecker, -
or accept the onset of a disaster of Biblical proportion.
What do you mean?
Old Testament, wrath-of-God stuff.
Fire and brimstone coming down.
Earthquakes, volcanoes ...
The dead rising from the grave!
Human sacrifice, mass hysteria!
Enough, I get the point!
But what if you're wrong?
Nothing happens! We go to jail,
quietly. We'll enjoy it.
But if I'm right, and we can stop this thing ...
... you will have saved the lives of millions of registered voters.
I don't believe you're seriously considering listening to these men.
Get him out of here.
Bye.
I'll fix you, Venkman.
I'm gonna miss him!
What do you need from me?
Let's run some red lights!
Hello, New York!
Dr. Ray Stanz.
The heart of the Ghostbusters!
They love you ...
I like that shirt, friend.
Got to run. Got a date with a ghost.
Whatever happens, be professional.
This might require overtime!
There they are!
It's all right. We're fine!
We can handle it!
They want to play rough.
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Do you want to play rough?
Let's do it!
Where are we?
In the teens, somewhere ...
When we get to twenty, tell me.
I'm gonna throw up.
Twenty-two. Is this it?
Yeah.
Art Deco. Very nice.
It's at the end of the hall.
Where do these stairs go?
They go up.
Go ahead. Come on.
Dana!
Okay, she's a dog.
It's a girl.
It's Gozer.
I thought Gozer was a man.
Whatever it is, it has to get by us.
Go get her, Ray!
Gozer the Gozarian!
Good evening. As a representative of the city of New York, -
I order you to cease all supernatural activity -
and return to your place of origin.
That ought to do it. Thanks, Ray.
Are you a god?
No.
Then ... die!
When someone asks you if you're a god, say "yes"!
All right, this chick is toast!
Grab your stick.
Holding!
Heat them up!
Smoking!
Make them hard!
Ready!
Let's show this prehistoric bitch how we do things downtown.
Throw it!
Nimble little minx.
Go full stream.
Aim for the flat-top!
That wasn't so hard.
We neutronised it.
A complete particle reversal.
We had the tools and the talent!
It's Miller time.
Ray, this looks extraordinarily bad.
Look out!
Sub-creatures! Gozer the Gozerian,
the Destructor, Zildrohar...
The Travellerhas come.
Choose andperish.
What do you mean?
Choose.
Choose the form ofthe Destructor.
I get it! Very cute.
Whatever we think of will appear and destroy us. Empty your heads!
Don't think of anything.
The choice is made.
The Travellerhas come.
Nobody chose anything!
Did you choose anything? Did you?
I didn't choose anything!
I couldn't help it.
It just popped in there.
What just popped in there?
I tried to think.
Look!
No! It can't be.
What did you do?
Oh, shit!
It's the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.
You don't see thatevery day.
It was something I loved as a kid.
Something that could never destroy us. Mr. Stay-Puft.
Nice thinking.
We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows by the fire.
Ray has gone bye-bye.
What have you got left?
I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.
Oh, no.
Mother puss bucket!
Nobody steps on a church here!
One, two, three, roast him!
It's funny, us getting killed by a 100-foot marshmallow man.
Stay-Puft is okay. He's a sailor in New York. We'll get him laid.
We could reverse the particle flow through the gate.
How?.
We'll cross the streams.
You said that was bad.
Cross the streams ...
You're endangering the nice lady who paid us before she became a dog.
There's a slim chance we'll survive.
I love this plan! Let's do it!
This job isn't worth the money.
Hurry!
See you on the other side.
Nice working with you.
Turn them on, Spengler!
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Venkman ... Spengler!
Venkman!
Spengler!
Spengler, are you okay?.
I feel like the floor of a taxi.
Venky!
Thank God.
Are you okay?.
I'm all right.
Are you okay?.
Fine.
It smells like barbecued dog hair.
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I just forgot.
Look!
Turn on the lights!
Go check on that little guy.
What happened?
Where am l?
Oh, hi.
The superintendent will be pissed.
Are you okay?.
Who are you guys?
We're the Ghostbusters.
Who does your taxes?
You are a fortunate individual.
You have participated in the biggest inter-dimensional rip since 1909.
We'd like a sample of your brain.
I love this town!
What's going on? Does anyone want an interview?. I'm an eyewitness!
